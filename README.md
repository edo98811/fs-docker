This can work on any folder, what needs to be written ever time is a funtion to find the subject name in the directory tree every time an mri is found. it can be a directory level, a part of the directory name, anthing. The mri that have the same subject name are put togehter and are considered as from the same subject. 


### Commands 

 - table (tablenifti)
 To run first you need to run create table, it can be either done starting from nifti or from dicom, default is starting from dicom, when you want to start from nifti you need to use the command tablenifti. 
 This creates a table that contains all the info on the subjects ordered in these columns: 
 ID, mris, paths. 
 Then all of these data are completed 
 - samseg
 - convert
 - register
 - fstables


#### Workflow example: 
    install softweare runnning install.sh
    set in settings the parameters and the substrings to to check for matching
    run prepare dicom on the raw folder (can also be external or tmp)
    create the table
    run convert nifti 
    run reconall 
        or 
    run registration 
    run samseg
